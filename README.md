# TwitterSentimentAnalyser
This Python script allows you to search for tweets containing a specific keyword from the past 7 days and perform sentiment analysis on them. The tool uses the Twitter API v2 to fetch tweets and TextBlob for analyzing sentiment polarity (Positive, Negative, Neutral). Results are saved to a CSV file for easy analysis.
